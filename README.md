# Advent of Code 2024

Implements Advent of Code puzzles of year 2024

## Running

Start the project in VSCode with `F5`.
Or run the bash script: start.sh

## Problems

### Day 1: Historian Hysteria

Simple parallel traversal of 2 lists, sorted first.

### Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports

The 'safe' check per report is implemented with a few if statements.

### Day 3: Mull It Over

Made a full parser, iso using regular expressions to simplify the task.
Because that is wat SmallJS is buit on :-).

### Day 4: Ceres search

Brute force searching XMAS in all directions from all points of the grid.
The Point type of Smalltalk keeps things concise.

### Day 7: Bridge Repair

Encoded the operators '+' and '*' as 0 and 1 bits in an integer operatorBits,
so you can enumerate all operator combinations by just increasing this integer value.
