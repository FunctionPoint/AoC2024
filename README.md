# Advent of Code 2024

Implements Advent of Code puzlzes 2024

## Running

Start the project in VSCode with `F5`.
Or run the bash script: start.sh

## Problems

### Day 1

Simple parallel traversal of 2 lists, sorted first.

### Day 2

The 'safe' check per report is implemented with a few if statements.

### Day 3

Made a full parser, iso using regular expressions to simplify the task.
Because that is wat SmallJS is buit on :-).
